Scientists to test theory about light that could completely change our view of the universe and prove Einstein wrong
- "the speed of light is fundamental and never changes" -> isn't it: the speed of light is a maximal possible velocity and is (considered) a constant? Than imaging, that just after the Big Bang it was higher is not that difficult - it would be still maximal possible speed (as reached by massless photons) the same as today; and idea of speed of light decreasing on the timescale of the age of the Universe is really digestable, than timescale of human beings would be so short, that the actual value could be treated as a constant
- Professor Joao Magueijo, from Imperial College London, proposed the theory in 1990s;
